#Depth

We want to add some depth to our game. Right now, having a purley top-down game depth isn't all that important. But as we experiment with different perspectives (Including isometric) depth is about to become very improtant.

As you will see, there are two ways of handling depth, with a z buffer or with the painters algorithm. Neither method is better or worse, for the most part which one you use is your preference. 

I prefer to use z buffers myself, they requie a lot less code to write and is the method used when dealing with 3D graphics.
