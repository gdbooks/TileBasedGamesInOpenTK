#Chapter 5 - Map Tools

###Online Tilemap Editor
The [Online Tilemap Editor](http://apps.elias.media/Online-Tile-Map-Editor/) is an HTML5 tile editor you can use right from your browser! Even more impressive, it's Open Source and on [Github](https://github.com/elias-schuett/Online-Tile-Map-Editor). I like this editor because it's fast, easy and doesn't require any installation. I dislike the data output format, the final output needs a lot of love for it to be usable.

###Array Painter
By far the simplest tool I've found has been a little Java Applet called [Array Painter](http://www.arraypainter.com/). I made a local backup of it's [JAR](Files/arraypainter.zip) file in case it ever goes offline. This is what the application looks like:



Go to the [applications website](http://www.arraypainter.com/), download the application. This download will give you a **jnlp** file, which is a shortcut to a Java Web App. (Want to know where the real app is? Open the jnlp file with sublimte text to see what it launches). 

There is a catch tough, windows has blocked jnlp applets by default. To launch the application, you must do the following once:

* Open the [Java Control Panel](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/win_controlpanel.xml)
* Click the **Security** tab
* Click the **Edit Site List** button
* Add the following URL to the list
  * TODO: Figure this out

###Using Array Painter

##A Better Tool?
All of the tools we've explored in this chapter are pretty nifty, but let's face it none of them are a slam dunk one stop solution for us. This is just the nature of tools, there is no such thing as really generic. If you feel like being a bad-ass you can write your own tool for editing maps. I for one would love to see a more up to date and useful version of Array Painter. It's a project i might actually take on one day.

Making a tile editor is not required, but if you feel up to it it's a fun little side project and a great review of using Windows Forms.
