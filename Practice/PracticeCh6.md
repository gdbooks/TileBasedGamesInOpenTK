#On Your Own
Now that we've covered how to create and draw a tile based map, it's time for you to play around a bit on your own. This challenge is going to test your understanding of creating tile based maps. You will need to create a single room. Try your best to write all the code for this setion from scratch, only use the code from the last section if you get stuck.

###New Project
Create a new project, call it **TilePractice** and make the standard window appear. Don't forget to set your working directory correctly. Follow this chapter along in this new solution.
