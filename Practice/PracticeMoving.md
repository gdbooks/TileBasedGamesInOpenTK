#On Your Own
We now have a way to make the character walk on screen! Huzza! One small problem we're having here is that the hero is just kind of sliding around on the screen! While animations are not required to make a decent game demo, they help. A lot. So in this section we're going to add animations to our Hero!

###New Project
Let's make a new project, call it **MovingPractice** and get this project up to par with the **KeysToMove** section of the writeup.

###Getting started
We will have to change code in the ```Character``` class, and add new code to the ```PlayerCharacter``` class to support animations. Keep in mind, i'm only going to give you guidance to how i would implement animation. You can follow my lead, or come up with your own way of doing things. There is no right or wrong way. So long as it looks right and runs fast it's good!
