#Isometric View

Isometric worlds are great, they can add a lot of depth and visual appeal to a simple tile based game. Just look at Diablo 2, or Starcraft 1! 

There are some [great resources](http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-isometric-worlds-a-primer-for-game-developers--gamedev-6511) online that really get into the nitty gritty of how isometric views work. They are worth a read.

Movement in an iso world doesn't have to be smooth. I think [This](http://www.gotoandplay.it/_articles/2007/03/isometric.php) demo fels awesome, and the character is snapped to a grid the whole time! Of course we are going to have smooth movement in our version.
