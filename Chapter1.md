Make a new visual studio solution, i called mine "TileBasedGames"

STEP1

Notice that this created a new solution called TileBasedGames as well as a new project called TileBasedGames. Go ahead and delete the project. Right click the project and select Remove. Click "OK" on the confirm dialog.

STEP2

If you look at the "TileBasedGames" folder there are two things in there, a solution named "TileBasedGames" and a folder named "TileBasedGames". The folder contains the project we just deleted. Go ahead and delete that folder.

STEP3

Also, before we do anything else, add a .gitignore file. Use the [Visual Studio](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore) template. 

Go ahead and commit this, we now have a repo to work out of.
