Make a new visual studio solution, i called mine "TileBasedGames"

STEP1

Notice that this created a new solution called TileBasedGames as well as a new project called TileBasedGames. Go ahead and delete the project. Right click the project and select Remove. Click "OK" on the confirm dialog.

STEP2

If you look at the "TileBasedGames" folder there are two things in there, a solution named "TileBasedGames" and a folder named "TileBasedGames". The folder contains the project we just deleted. Go ahead and delete that folder.

STEP3

Also, before we do anything else, add a .gitignore file. Use the [Visual Studio](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore) template. 

Lets also add an Assets folder next to the solution. This is where we are going to keep all shared game assets. All in all your folder structre should look like this:

TODO: STep 4, i don't have screenshot yet.

Don't forget to set your working directory
Make sure you have latest!
GABOR TODO: Submit nearest neighbor changelist

Go ahead and commit this, we now have a repo to work out of.


#TODO
Creating tiles: Upload final zip!
