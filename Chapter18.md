#Getting Items
We can walk around, switch rooms and even kill enemies. It's almost like we have a game starting to shape up! In the last section we added bullets, now let's add the opposite. Items! Our items are going to be simple. The player will have a running score, collecting an item will add some number (item dependant) to that score.

Why do i call items the opposite of bullets? Because they don't interesect the enemies, they intersect the player! You will find much of the code is going to be similar to how bullets work. I still think an item is a non moving anti-bullet.

###New Project
Let's make a new project, call it **GettingItems** and get this project up to par with the **Shooting** section of the writeup. We're going to work from here.
